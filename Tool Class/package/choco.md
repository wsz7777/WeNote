## 350 错误

I've seen the same behavior. For CLI weenies:

Check if you've got a pending file rename interfering with your desired operation:
```
REG QUERY "HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager" /v PendingFileRenameOperations
```

If you do, and you're sure you know what you're doing:
```
REG DELETE "HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager" /v PendingFileRenameOperations /f
```
